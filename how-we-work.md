## How We Work

<i>How</i> we work is almost as important as <i>what</i> we work at. 
There are enough resources in this world to ensure that we all get what we need to live in a healthy, balanced way. 
If there are people who are without, it is only because someone else has taken it from them. 

It is a truth that no individual can create all the things that surround us; cars, radios, skyscrapers, aeroplanes, turbines, smart phones. We <i>need</i> to collaborate and pool our knowledge, skills and resources to bring these things to life. And so it is with this project.

Whilst, once, this project was small enough to be the dream of one man, that dream has grown to something much bigger and, in the process, has become our dream too. 

As Trustees, we work to pool our diverse knowledge, skills, experience, backgrounds, working styles, thinking styles and much more besides to continue to breathe life into this dream. What knits us together are our shared values.

### Our Values

* **Equality** - We believe all are born equal. Specifically, that everyone has the right to access quality, medical healthcare regardless of their ability to pay, their gender, ethnicity, age, religious or political persuasion, sexual orientation or any other differentiating factor.
* **Community** - We acknowledge that humans do not and cannot successfully operate in isolation from one another. Neither as near neighbours, nor as neighbours separated by continents. We believe in ‘community’ in the broadest sense of the word and will work to support the users and employees of the Clinic to overcome difficulties, inequalities and threats to their wellbeing and the wellbeing of this project. We seek, as a charity, to emulate the sense of mutual trust and belonging that has developed and deepened between Trevor and Adisu, with the rural community of Lalibela.
* **Ambition** - We are ambitious in our plans for the Lalibela New Life Medical Centre, supporting it to deliver lasting change to the community of people it serves for generations to come. We believe there is a solution for every problem.
* **Greater than the sum of our parts** - We recognise we are stronger together than alone. We believe in what we are doing and know that respecting our combined knowledge and pooling our combined talents is the most effective way of achieving the Trust’s aims. We are committed to developing our talent pool in any way we can.
* **Caring** - We believe in the healing and restorative power of human caring for one another and will promote this whenever we can.

### Fundraising and Practical Support
