## Support Us

We are a small organisation with a big agenda. As a Trust, we have just one beneficiary; a medical clinic in the Lalibela area of rural Ethiopia, which we have had built for the poor farming communities that live there.

Our sole purpose, as a Trust, is to raise funds and source medical and other supplies for this very important community resource. Without this clinic, people would suffer unnecessarily, even dying from wounds and illness that could otherwise be treated.

> ONE HUNDRED PERCENT of all monies donated to the Lalibela New Life Medical Trust go directly on the running and maintenance of the clinic and its staff.  

### Individuals

If you are an individual looking to support a Charity and would like to know more before deciding whether our clinic is the one for you, then please get in touch for a chat. Otherwise, one off donations can be made [here]({{ 'donate' | absolute_url }}) via PayPal Giving, which not only ensures 100% of your donation will be paid to us, but will also add on Gift Aid, if you are an eligible UK tax payer.

Monthly standing order payments can also be made through PayPal. If you would like to make a specific one-off or on-going contribution to a particular aspect of the clinic, for example to pay the wages of one of the clinic nurses, then please [get in touch]({{ '#footer' | absolute_url}}) and we will be happy to provide you with regular updates and perhaps even photos, as to how your donation is helping.

### Organisations

If you are an organisation that would like to sponsor the Lalibela New Life Medical Centre, or can help with fund raising, then please [get in touch]({{ '#footer' | absolute_url}}) for a chat.

### Grant Funds

If you are a grant funder and are able to support us with a grant but would first like to know more about the important work we do to help alleviate unnecessary suffering in this small corner of the world, then please [get in touch]({{ '#footer' | absolute_url}}).
