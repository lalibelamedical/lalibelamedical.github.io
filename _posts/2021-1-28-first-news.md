I cannot say what drove Adisu to the standard he reached, but he has always obviously been one who strives to be the best possible at his job. I knew only that he was desperate to find something more worthwhile than being a tour guide, with its poor prospects for a steady future. He expressed an interest in doing nursing as a way of giving something to the local community, with which he still identifies closely. 

The shortage of qualified medical personnel is a factor that is extremely important in Ethiopia and is continually worsened by the general desire to emigrate and earn vastly higher incomes. A fundamental condition of my support for him, before I paid anything, was that he should remain in the community to work there and he accepted this restriction without any hesitation.
